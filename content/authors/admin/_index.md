I am a lecturer of research methods in psychology at [ISN Psychology](https://isn.edu.au/) and a researcher in the Cognitive Behaviour Therapy Research Unit at [ISN Innovations](https://isn.edu.au/research-2/) (Melbourne, Australia). My current research focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of electronic health (eHealth) interventions for reducing psychological stress and improving wellbeing using randomized controlled trial methodologies.
