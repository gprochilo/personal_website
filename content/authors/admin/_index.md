Hi – I’m Guy. I'm a PhD student in psychological science at the University of Melbourne. My current research focus is a pilot and feasibility trial of an aerobic exercise and mindfulness-based intervention, where each training modality is completed concurrently. The goal of this project is to assess the feasibility of a definitive trial, and to examine its preliminary effect on chronic psychosocial stress in a nonclinical population.

<span style="font-size:0.9em;">
I'm also an advocate for open science practices, reproducibility, and for taking a confidence interval approach to statistical inference. I'm proficient in R and have published my own [R statistical package on GitHub](https://github.com/gprochilo/aha). I'm also interested in post-publication peer review, and have [published work](https://psyarxiv.com/hv3rm) evaluating the use (and misuse) of statistics in organizational neuroscience. [Check out my CV](https://www.guyprochilo.com/files/cv.pdf) for more on my work.
