<br>

I am a lecturer of research methods in psychology and a researcher in the Cognitive Behaviour Therapy Research Unit at ISN Psychology (Melbourne, Australia). My current research focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of electronic health (eHealth) interventions using trial methods. I have also [published work](https://open.lnu.se/index.php/metapsychology/article/view/935) evaluating the use (and misuse) of statistics in organizational neuroscience. More generally, I have a keen interest in open science, research reproducibility, and taking a frequentist approach to inference with a focus on confidence interval estimation.
