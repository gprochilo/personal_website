<p style="font-size:18px;"> Hi – I’m Guy. My current research focus is a <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/8w45k" target="_blank">pilot and feasibility trial</a> of an aerobic exercise and mindfulness-based intervention, where each training modality is completed concurrently. The goal of this project is to assess the feasibility of a definitive trial, and to examine its preliminary effect on chronic psychosocial stress in a nonclinical population.</p>  

<p style="font-size:18px;"> I'm also an advocate for open science practices, reproducibility, and for taking a confidence interval approach to statistical inference. I'm proficient in R and have published an <a href="https://github.com/gprochilo/aha" target="_blank">R statistical package on GitHub</a>. I'm also interested in post-publication peer review, and have <a href="https://psyarxiv.com/hv3rm" target="_blank">published work</a> evaluating the use (and misuse) of statistics in organizational neuroscience.</p> 

<p style="font-size:18px;"> Want to get in contact? Feel free to <a href="https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=1119310284" target="_blank">message me on Twitter</a> or <a href="mailto:guy.prochilo@gmail.com">send me an email</a>.</p>
